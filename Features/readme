This folder contains averaged GOG features for person images from camera 1 in RPIfield.
For example, we have an image sequence of person 1 containing 10 person images, 
we first extract GOG features for all 10 images for person 1, 
then 10 GOG feature vectors are averaged to get one feature vector for the image sequence.
Camera 1 contains 485 image sequences, so we got 485 GOG feature vectors corresponding to each appearance.
